# Cybersecurity AI Prototype Repository

This repository demonstrates a production-grade integration of AI with cybersecurity operations. It showcases how advanced AI techniques—such as anomaly detection and automated response—can enhance the capabilities of a Security Operations Center (SOC). The prototype processes system logs, detects potential threats, and triggers automated responses, proving its real-world impact in addressing modern cybersecurity challenges.

## Overview

This prototype integrates AI with cybersecurity operations to:
- **Detect Anomalies:** Leverage transformer models to analyze system logs or network data and identify potential security threats.
- **Automate Incident Response:** Trigger automated alerts and responses based on detected anomalies.
- **Ensure Production-Grade Reliability:** Demonstrate secure API development, robust data ingestion, AI integration, and system orchestration in a scalable solution.

By building this prototype, I showcase the skills required for an AI Engineering Lead—delivering production-ready, scalable, and secure AI solutions in the cybersecurity domain.

## Features

- **Anomaly Detection Module:**  
  Uses AI models to analyze logs and network data to detect unusual patterns or potential threats.

- **Incident Response Engine:**  
  Implements logic to trigger automated alerts and responses when anomalies are detected.

- **Secure REST API:**  
  Provides API endpoints for data ingestion, threat analysis, and automated response generation, with comprehensive input validation and authentication.

- **Deployment & Orchestration:**  
  Includes Dockerfiles, Kubernetes manifests (or Docker Compose files), and CI/CD pipeline configurations (using GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or Terraform) for automated and scalable deployments.

## Architecture

The system is divided into the following key components:
- **Data Ingestion & Processing:** Collects and preprocesses logs and network data.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Uses AI models to identify unusual activity.
- **Incident Response:** Automatically triggers alerts or remediation actions based on detected threats.
- **Secure API Gateway:** Exposes endpoints for external integration with proper authentication and error handling.
- **Deployment Layer:** Containerizes the application and orchestrates it with Kubernetes or Docker Compose, managed through CI/CD pipelines.
